# Webcam-image-classify
Classify any image with your webcam

Build a web image classification that runs in your browser

Step 1
Copy "index.html" into a text editor of your choice, I used sublime.

Step 2
Copry "index.js" into a text editor of your choice.

Step 3
Go into the physical location you stored the "index.html" and open with google chrome.

Step 4
Ensure your browser allows the use of your webcamara and hold up an object and see what the computer classifies it as.

Key points to note in this example:

In the above example, we used a pre-trained image classification model called MobileNet
We used ml5.js, a library built on top of TensorFlow.js, to load the MobileNet model into our browser and perform inference on the video feed
We also leveraged the P5.js library to process the video feed and display labels on the video itself.
